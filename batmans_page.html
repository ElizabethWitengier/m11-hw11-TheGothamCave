    <h2>Other Batmans</h2>
    <p>Holy revolving door, Batman! The Caped Crusader has been portrayed by more actors than any other superhero in movie history – eight to be exact. Most have lasted for just one film. But
after The Dark Knight Rises, Christian Bale has become the first man to have played Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego more than twice on the silver screen. He didn’t have much competition –
Michael Keaton was the only other actor to reprise the role at the time.</p>

      lukewarm reception. Some critics, like The New York Times's Janet Maslin,
      thought Kilmer was a poor successor to Keaton in the part, while others, such as
      Roger Ebert, had kind words for Kilmer.</p>
