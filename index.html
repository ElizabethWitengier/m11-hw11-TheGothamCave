        <p>Batman ventures into Gotham City's underworld when a sadistic killer leaves behind a trail of cryptic clues. As the evidence begins to lead closer to home and the scale of the perpetrator's plans become clear, he must forge new relationships, unmask the culprit and bring justice to the abuse of power and corruption that has long plagued the metropolis.</p>

          <h3>Rob Pattinson as Batman</h3>
            <p>In the name of his murdered parents, Bruce Wayne wages eternal war on the criminals of Gotham City. He is the vengeance. He is the night. He is Batman.</p>
            <p>A playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne's double life affords him the comfort of a life without financial worry, a loyal butler-turned-guardian, and the perfect base of operations in the ancient network of caves beneath his family's sprawling estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape and pointed cowl, and takes to the shadowy streets, skies, and rooftops of Gotham City.</p>

      <h3>Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman</h3>
        <p>As deadly as she is beautiful, infamous cat-burglar Selina Kyle uses her nine lives to walk the razor's edge between light and darkness in Gotham City.</p>
        <p>The Bat may be the king of the beasts in Gotham. But the Cat? The Cat is definitely the queen. Infamous burglar Selina Kyle is certainly one of the most iconic characters in the DC Universe because she's so good at stumping them. Motivated partly by her own self-interest, partly by the fun of it all, Catwoman has been baffling Gotham City's heroes, both masked and unmasked, from the very beginning.</p>

      <h3>Paul Dano as the Riddler</h3>
        <p>Riddle us this: what cerebral criminal with an affinity for purple and green loves challenging the Dark Knight with cleverly calculated crimes and puzzling plots?</p>
        <p>One of the Dark Knight's most infamous villains, Edward Nygma, enjoys flaunting his intellectual superiority by conducting crimes and leaving clues for Batman to piece together. His puzzle problem stems not only from his narcissism and ego but also from a deep-seated psychological compulsion. Because of this, the Riddler often finds himself a resident of Arkham Asylum following his inevitable capture.</p>

      <h3>Colin Farrell as the Penguin</h3>
        <p>Oswald Cobblepot. Not exactly a name designed to shake the pillars of Gotham's dark criminal underworld. Maybe it's his other name that strikes fear into the hearts of citizens both good and bad: The Penguin.</p>
        <p>This is a villain fueled by a pathological rage that compels him to turn his odd physique, bird-like profile, and awkward waddle into a well-dressed force for fear. At any given moment than he and he uses that information to blackmail, intimidate, and corrupt anyone he can, especially when it's in the service of bringing down Batman.</p>
