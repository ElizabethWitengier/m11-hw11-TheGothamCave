         <p>Batman ventures into Gotham City's underworld when a sadistic killer leaves behind a trail of cryptic clues. As the evidence begins to lead closer to home and the scale of the perpetrator's plans become clear, he must forge new relationships, unmask the culprit and bring justice to the abuse of power and corruption that has long plagued the metropolis.</p>

    <h4 id="Batman">Robert Pattison - Batman</h4>
    <img src="rob_pattinson_images/Robert_Pattinson 3.jpg" alt="Robert Pattison as Batman">
    <p>In the name of his murdered parents, Bruce Wayne wages eternal war on the criminals of Gotham City. He is the vengeance. He is the night. He is Batman.</p>
    <p>One of the most iconic fictional characters in the world, Batman had dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a war on all criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was just a child. Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near-perfection to be a self-made super hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he's assembled teams of his fellow DC super heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders, and Batman Incorporated.</p>
    <p>A playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne's double life affords him the comfort of a life without financial worry, a loyal butler-turned-guardian, and the perfect base of operations in the ancient network of caves beneath his family's sprawling estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape and pointed cowl, and takes to the shadowy streets, skies, and rooftops of Gotham City.</p>
    <h4 id="Catwoman">Zoe Kravitz - Catwoman</h4>
    <img src="supporting_characters_images/Catwoman.png" alt="Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman">
    <p>As deadly as she is beautiful, infamous cat-burglar Selina Kyle uses her nine lives to walk the razor's edge between light and darkness in Gotham City.</p>
    <p>The Bat may be the king of the beasts in Gotham. But the Cat? The Cat is definitely the queen. Infamous burglar Selina Kyle is certainly one of the most iconic characters in the DC Universe - not because she's a hero, per se, but because she's so good at stumping them. Motivated partly by her own self-interest, partly by the fun of it all, Catwoman has been baffling Gotham City's heroes, both masked and unmasked, from the very beginning.</p>
    <p>An accomplished jewel thief and an occasional hero herself, Selina's murky moral compass has made her relationship with Batman complicated, to say the least. Still, the undeniable magnetism between Bat and Cat is one of Gotham's most reliable constants: wherever Catwoman goes, Batman is sure to follow, if only to take her down. It's a complicated game of cat-and-mouse (cat-and-bat?) that Bruce and Selina have been playing across the streets and rooftops of Gotham for a long, long time.</p>
    <h4 id="Riddler">Paul Dano - Riddler</h4>
    <img src="supporting_characters_images/The_Riddler.png" alt="Paul Dano as the Riddler">
    <p>Riddle us this: what cerebral criminal with an affinity for purple and green loves challenging the Dark Knight with cleverly calculated crimes and puzzling plots?</p>
    <p>One of the Dark Knight's most infamous villains, Edward Nygma, enjoys flaunting his intellectual superiority by conducting crimes and leaving clues for Batman to piece together. While this habit constantly leads to the aptly-named Riddler failing in his criminal endeavors, his puzzle problem stems not only from his narcissism and ego but also from a deep-seated psychological compulsion. Because of this, the Riddler often finds himself a resident of Arkham Asylum following his inevitable capture.</p>
    <p>Possessing a genius-level intellect, the Riddler creates elaborate, sometimes Rube Goldberg-esque traps and is even willing to use innocent civilians as bait. Although not very physically imposing, the Riddler's brilliance, neurosis, and lack of empathy make him an incredibly dangerous foe. He cares very little - if at all - about the lives of those he uses in his plots and instead only sees them as disposable pawns in his continuing intellectual battles against Batman.</p>
    <h4 id="Penguin">Colin Farrell - Penguin</h4>
    <img src="supporting_characters_images/The_Penguin.png" alt="Colin Farrell as the Penguin">
    <p>Oswald Cobblepot. Not exactly a name designed to shake the pillars of Gotham's dark criminal underworld. Maybe it's his other name that strikes fear into the hearts of citizens both good and bad: The Penguin.</p>
    <p>This is a villain fueled by a pathological rage that compels him to turn his odd physique, bird-like profile, and awkward waddle into a well-dressed force for fear. No one knows more about what the evil forces of Gotham are up to at any given moment than he and he uses that information to blackmail, intimidate, and corrupt anyone he can, especially when it's in the service of bringing down Batman.</p>
    <p>They say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but they also say evil is as evil does. A master manipulator, the Penguin is usually surrounded by violent henchmen who do his bidding without question. But when it comes down to a face-to-face, expect him to unleash a deadly barrage from a variety of umbrella weapons and other ingenious devices - often taking the form of a fowl. And when all else fails, the Penguin will fight as dirty as they come; hand to hand combat doesn't ruffle his feathers at all.</p>
