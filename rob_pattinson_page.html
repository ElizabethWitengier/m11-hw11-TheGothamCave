		Robert Pattinson took on one of the most globally recognizable characters with The Batman. At this point, the character has shown up close to a dozen times in live-action alone, played by actors ranging from Michael Keaton to Ben Affleck. In this 2022 release, the former <em>Twilight</em> star give life to Bruce Wayne. He has been absolutely tremendous, vanishing completely into the role and giving a version of the character that is both familiar and unique. Pattinson said he’d been a fan of the character since his youth and wanted to do unique things with the character’s superhero and civilian identities that other films hadn’t touched on before. </p>
