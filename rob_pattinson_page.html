	  <p class="main_text__bio"> Robert Douglas Thomas Pattinson (born 13 May 1986) is an English actor. He is oted for his versatile roles in big-budget and independent films, Pattinson has been ranked among the world's highest-paid actors. In 2010, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people globally, and he was featured in the Forbes Celebrity 100 list.</p>

	  <h2>Blockbusters</h2>	
       </div>  
	  <p> Robert Pattinson is the latest in a long line of actors to play Batman, and in many  ways is the strangest choice since Val Kilmer and his Bat Nipples - possibly the  strangest ever. There’s no doubting Pattinson’s talent, but since the days of Twilight and Harry Potter he has religiously avoided franchises and blockbusters, opting  instead for enticing prestige indie flicks like Good Time, The Lighthouse, and High  Life. The closest he’s gotten to a blockbuster role like The Batman would either be Netflix’s star-studded but clearly-aiming-for-prestige-indie-status drama The Devil All the Time, or Christopher Nolan’s complex and complicated Tenet—neither of which  are classic blockbusters in the way a character like Batman is.</p>

	  <h2>Iconic Role</h2>	
       </div>  
          <p>Robert Pattinson took on one of the most globally recognizable characters with The Batman. At this point, the character has shown up close to a dozen times in live-action alone, played by actors ranging from Michael Keaton to Ben Affleck. In this 2022 release, the former <em>Twilight</em> star give life to Bruce Wayne. He has been absolutely tremendous, vanishing completely into the role and giving a version of the character that is both familiar and unique. Pattinson said he had been a fan of the character since his youth and wanted to do unique things with the character’s superhero and civilian identities that other films hadn’t touched on before.</p>

	  <h2>Alter Ego</h2>	
        </div> 
	  <p>With such atypical casting, it makes sense that Pattinson sees himself as something of an atypical Batman. “The first time I read the script was a pretty drastic departure from Bruce Wayne's portrayed traditional way. He's very much in control of the three aspects of his personality. He’s Bruce Wayne, the playboy, a little bit silly, and then he's the Bruce at home, who's - I’m just describing the old movies now, whatever! But this one, he doesn't know. He's let Bruce just withered away. He hasn't  worked on himself at all, apart from this mysterious way where you think the only way you can survive is creating this alter ego, which he wants to live in more and more. I think he doesn't have fully control over what's happening to him when he puts that suit on, and he genuinely believes he's another person. And then when the red light comes on, it calls him out. I mean, it's  almost like he's more afraid of his identity being revealed than dying.</p>

	  <h2>New Style</h2>	
	</div>
	  <p>This new style of Batman also led, Pattinson feels, to a new type of Batman story.  “They're pretty big stakes,” he says. “The mayor gets killed and stuff but what I love [is]  the Batman isn't even known as Batman in the city. He's literally just some guy with an  outfit on. And Gordon's saying like… eh. He's really out on a limb, he has some  advanced technology but like, not really. He's just a guy who Gordon believes in. And I  think that the belief in him Bruce values so much because he's literally the only person  at this point in the story. Not even Alfred thinks it's a good idea.” </p>
